    <h>In 1961, the Frito Company, founded by  Charles E. Doolin, merged with Layâ€™s, forming 
             Frito-Lay Inc., a snack food giant with combined sales of over $127 million annually,
             which was then the highest sales revenue earned by any manufacturer. Shortly thereafter,
             Lay's introduced what became its best-known slogan: "betcha can't eat just one". Sales 
             of the chips became international, with marketing assisted by a number of celebrity 
             endorsers. Annual revenues for Frito-Lay exceeded $180 million by 1965, when the 
             company had more than 8,000 employees and 46 manufacturing plants
       In 1965, Frito-Lay merged with the Pepsi-Cola Company to form PepsiCo, Inc. In 1991, the 
       company introduced a new formulation of their chip that was crisper and kept fresher longer
       . Shortly thereafter, the company introduced the "Wavy Lay's" products to grocery shelves,
        with a national rollout in 1994.[7] In the mid- to late 1990s, Lay's introduced a lower-calorie
         baked variety, and a fat-free variety (Lay's WOW chips) that contained the fat substitute olestra.</h>

                            In 1934, salesman Herman Lay opened a snack food operation 
                            in Nashville, Tennessee.[4] In 1938, he purchased the 
                            Atlanta, Georgia-based potato chip manufacturer "Barrett Food
                             Company", renaming it "H.W. Lay Lingo & Company". Lay crisscrossed 
                             the southern United States, selling the product from the trunk of 
                             his car.

                            The business shortened its name to "the Lay's Lay Lingo Company" 
                            in 1944 and became the first snack food manufacturer to
                            purchase television commercials, using Bert Lahr as its celebrity 
                            spokesperson.
